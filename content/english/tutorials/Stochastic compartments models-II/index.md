title: "Estimating R0 & Least-Squares Fitting of SIR/SEIR in R"
description: "Estimate R₀ from outbreak final size data, both with and without pre-existing immunity. Then fit deterministic SIR and time-varying SEIR models to real incidence data using `lsoda` and `optim`. Participants will implement the Gaussian least-squares objective, obtain MLEs for β and γ (and β₀, β₁, t₁, w for SEIR), and compare fitted curves with the U.S. Omicron wave and Sweden case data."
