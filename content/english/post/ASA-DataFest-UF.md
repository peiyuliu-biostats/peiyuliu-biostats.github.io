### ASA DataFest 2025 at UF


This year’s ASA DataFest at UF focused on real estate data — visualization, forecasting, and analysis. I had the great pleasure of serving as a judge and working with talented master’s and undergraduate teams throughout the weekend.  

We awarded the **Judge’s Choice Award** to the *Real World Evidence* team, whose creative use of **ggplot for interactive visualization** and **regression modeling** left a strong impression.

Always inspiring to see the next generation of data scientists bring ideas to life!
