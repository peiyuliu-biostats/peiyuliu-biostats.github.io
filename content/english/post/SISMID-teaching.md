### Teaching at SISMID 2025, Emory University

It was a great honor to serve as an instructor for the Stochastic Epidemic Models with Inference module at SISMID, together with Professors [Ira Longini](https://phhp.ufl.edu/profile/longini-ira/) and [Tom Britton](https://staff.math.su.se/tom.britton/).  

During the course, I guided participants in using **R** for model building, data fitting, and simulations. We worked through topics such as *important properties of epidemics and endemic situations* and *modeling with networks and heterogeneities*.  

I really enjoyed the energy in the classroom â€” participants asked thoughtful questions and were deeply engaged throughout.
